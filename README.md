## Getting Started

To get started with the game, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Compile the C++ code using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++).

3. Run the compiled executable.

4. Select the game mode (Player vs Player or Computer vs Player) and enjoy!

## Game Rules

- The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
- Players take turns marking a cell with their symbol ('X' or 'O').
- The player who first gets three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.
- If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game is a draw.

## Gameplay

- Use the number keys (1-9) to make your move on the grid.
- Follow the on-screen prompts to input your name (in Computer vs Player mode) and make your moves.


## Acknowledgments

- Inspired by the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe.
